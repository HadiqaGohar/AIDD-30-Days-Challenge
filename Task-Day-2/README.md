### 1. Nine Pillars Understanding

**Q1: Why using AI agents for repetitive setup tasks helps me grow as a system architect:**  
**A1:** AI agents handle boring tasks like folders, configs, and tests, saving hours. That time goes straight into big-picture thinking, system design, and planning for scale. I stop being a typist and start thinking like a real architect.

**Q2: How the Nine Pillars help me become an M-Shaped Developer:**  
**A2:** The Nine Pillars act like a team around me. I can go deep in 2–4 areas I love while AI handles the rest, letting me build multiple strong skills instead of just one.

### 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

**Q1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?**

**A1:** Vibe Coding focuses on quick coding without clear specifications. This often leads to messy, hard-to-extend architecture, unclear logic, and bugs that pile up as the project grows.

**Q2: How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?**

**A2:** Specification-Driven Development sets clear requirements and structure before coding. It ensures the system is well-planned, maintainable, and scalable, reducing bugs and architectural issues.

**Q1: How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?**

**A1:** Developers shift from typing code line by line to **planning, designing, and guiding AI**. Their main job becomes thinking strategically, reviewing outputs, and ensuring the system works at scale.

**Q2: Why must developers think in layers and systems instead of raw code?**

**A2:** Thinking in layers and systems ensures the software is **organized, scalable, and maintainable**. Focusing only on raw code leads to messy, hard-to-extend projects.
