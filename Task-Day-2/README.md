### 1. Nine Pillars Understanding

**Why using AI agents for repetitive setup tasks helps me grow as a system architect:**  
**A1:** AI agents handle boring tasks like folders, configs, and tests, saving hours. That time goes straight into big-picture thinking, system design, and planning for scale. I stop being a typist and start thinking like a real architect.

**How the Nine Pillars help me become an M-Shaped Developer:**  
**A2:** The Nine Pillars act like a team around me. I can go deep in 2–4 areas I love while AI handles the rest, letting me build multiple strong skills instead of just one.

### 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development

**Q1: Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?**
**A1:** Vibe Coding focuses on quick coding without clear specifications. This often leads to messy, hard-to-extend architecture, unclear logic, and bugs that pile up as the project grows.

**Q2: How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?**
**A2:** Specification-Driven Development sets clear requirements and structure before coding. It ensures the system is well-planned, maintainable, and scalable, reducing bugs and architectural issues.
